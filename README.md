Using Musit: 

To use Musit, download the application and open to the splash screen. You will be prompted to login with Facebook, we require Facebook in order to manage your social experience with Musit. We do not currently support other or native login services. Once logged in, press ‘New Conversation’ to start a new conversation and type in the name of another Musit user. You can select multiple users per conversation. Users can also be found by pressing ‘Find Friends’ and clicking on a user’s profile. Use the ‘+/x’ icon in the top-right of a profile to add/remove a user as a friend. 

Once the conversation participants have been chosen, you can type in a song recommendation. Tap on the services at the top of the pop-up list to select which service you would like to use, either Soundcloud or Spotify. Musit will deep-link you to that service if the service is installed on your device by tapping on the recommendation once sent. The conversations listed on the homescreen can be updated by dragging down on the page to refresh.

Music profiles display user’s sent and received recommendations without displaying any attached messages. 

Enjoy using Musit!
